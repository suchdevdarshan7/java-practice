Spy Number in Java


Question:

Write a Java program that takes an integer input from the user and performs the following operations:

Count the number of digits in the input number.
Calculate the sum of all the digits of the input number.
If the sum obtained is greater than or equal to 10, repeatedly calculate the sum of the digits of the result until a single-digit number is obtained.
Print the final single-digit result.
Example:
Input: 9875
Sum of digits: 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29
Since 29 is greater than 10, calculate the sum of its digits: 2 + 9 = 11
Again, since 11 is greater than 10, calculate the sum of its digits: 1 + 1 = 2
Output: The ans is 2

Constraints:

Assume the input is always a positive integer.
Do not use any in-built functions for digit sum calculation.
